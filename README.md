# Comment 
 After reading the article I realised the importance of ethics classes and how needed they are within the field of software engineering.
The article makes good points regarding how software companies operate and how they deflect ethical responsbilities behind the guise 
of being classified as a "technology company", that they merely provide technology and do not need to consider the societal changes the 
technology may occur (see Facebook/Reddit with the spread of fake news). The article, however, makes a good point that these are symptoms 
of the fact that when are learning to become software engineers, we are never truly pushed to consider the ethical choices and responsibilities 
our software takes on. I am in agreement with the sentiment of the article, as having previously worked on ethical studies surrounding software 
engineering, I am aware of how increasingly invasive and ethically "blurry" a lot of software is becoming. Over the course of the past few years
we have seen many software technologies emmerge that pry at the user's privacy (tracking location, holding personal information without 
consent, etc) and the various scandals that surround them (such as the Siri privacy scandal in 2019). It is also important to note that 
there are also softwares now that employ people and have an affect on a person's income, such as Uber, which have come into controversy 
recently due to their poor working conditions for their drivers. I believe that it is imperative that an ethical framework is founded for the field 
such as the ones seen in medicine and law, as we may see these technologies become increasingly more intrusive and ethically ambigious in nature.
